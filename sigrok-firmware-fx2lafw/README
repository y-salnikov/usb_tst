The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw is a Free/Libre/Open-source firmware for logic
analyzers based on the Cypress EZ-USB FX2(LP) chip.


Status
------

sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw is in a usable state and has had official
tarball releases.


Requirements
------------

 - git
 - make
 - autoconf >= 2.63
 - automake >= 1.11
 - sdcc (>= 2.9.0)

Notes:

 - In order to build fx2lafw you need the 'sdcc' compiler (>= 2.9.0).
   On Debian you can install it via:

     $ apt-get install sdcc

   This project has been tested to work with sdcc 2.9 and 3.x.

 - You need libsigrok >= 0.1.1 in order to make use of fx2lafw. Earlier
   versions didn't have support for FX2 devices using this firmware.


Building and installing
-----------------------

In order to get the sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw source code and build it, run:

 $ git clone git://sigrok.org/sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw
 $ cd sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

For installing sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw:

 $ make install

The generated *.fw files are installed into /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware.

You can override the install location like this:

 $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

See INSTALL or the following wiki page for more (OS-specific) instructions:

Pre-built firmware files
------------------------

There are also pre-built firmware files that can be used without having
to build them from source. You can download those from SourceForge:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/sigrok/files/binary/sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw/


fx2lib
------

The fx2lafw code uses a (slightly modified) "fx2lib" helper library.

It was imported into fx2lafw from

  git://github.com/ubixum/fx2lib.git

as of Feb 12, 2012 (git hash "416c104cbd").

The following files/directories were removed, as they're not needed
for our purposes: CHANGELOG, COPYING*, docs/, examples/, fw/, and utils/.
