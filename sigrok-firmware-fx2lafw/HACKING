HACKING

Coding style
------------

This project is programmed using the Linux kernel coding style, see
http://lxr.linux.no/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle for details.

Please use the same style for any code contributions, thanks!

In some exceptional cases deviations from the above coding guidelines are
OK (in order to meet fx2lib related guidelines, for example).


Contributions
-------------

 - Patches should be sent to the development mailinglist at
   sigrok-devel@lists.sourceforge.net (please subscribe to the list first).

   https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sigrok-devel

 - Alternatively, you can also clone the git repository and let us know
   from where to pull/review your changes. You can use gitorious.org,
   github.com, or any other public git hosting site.


Random notes
------------

 - Consistently use the same naming convention for #include guards in headers:
   <PROJECTNAME>_<PATH_TO_FILE>_<FILE>
   This ensures that all #include guards are always unique and consistent.
   Example: FX2LAFW_INCLUDE_COMMAND_H

 - In Doxygen comments, put an empty line between the block of @param lines
   and the final @return line. The @param lines themselves (if there is more
   than one) are not separated by empty lines.


Release engineering
-------------------

See

 http://sigrok.org/wiki/Developers/Release_process

for a list of items that need to be done when releasing a new tarball.
